She learned here how to channel her undying love of acting and her  drive to become an actress and exploit efficiently her natural beauty.  This, with the help of our Artistic Director  Joan See, landed her the role of wild child &ldquo;Stephanie Johnson&rdquo; on the <em>Days of our Lives</em>,  for which she was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in 2010. A swiftly rising star, Shelley effortlessly transitioned to primetime as  &ldquo;Diana,&rdquo; the sweet-natured  coven leader determined to use her magic for good, in the new CW drama, <em>The Secret Circle</em>, which premiered on September 15th on the CW. </p><p><em>'NYCDA turned me into a confident, working actress, something I never thought was possible! Their amazing faculty gave me the tools, knowledge, and experience I needed to get out into the entertainment world and not just do well, but stand out.

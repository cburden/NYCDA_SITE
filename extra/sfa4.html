<h2>Loans</h2>
<p>A part of your financial aid package may be a loan. You may have been offered a loan or we may have suggested that you borrow through the Direct Student Loan Program. There are two types of loans in the Direct Loan Program. Student borrowers apply for the Direct Subsidized and/or Unsubsidized Loan. Parent borrowers will be apply for the Direct PLUS Loan.</p>

<p>A loan must be repaid. Therefore, when deciding whether to borrow, you should examine your need for assistance and your future ability to repay. Unlike consumer loans, student loans have longer terms of repayment and in most cases are not repayable until you leave school. Interest rates vary from program to program but are usually lower than rates on loans made to the general public. The precise terms of the loans are contained in the promissory notes that borrowers must sign.</p>

<p>The descriptions given here are summaries of terms available at the time of printing and are subject to change. </p>

<p>If a Direct Subsidiized Loan, a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or a Direct PLUS Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) has been suggested on your Financial Aid Award Letter. Instructions will be sent on how to electronically complete your Master Promissory Note (MPN for new borrowers of a Direct Student loan). Follow the instructions on how to complete the student loan online. Print and keep the “borrower copy” for your records. Do not delay. Allow at least six (6) weeks from the time you return your application until your money arrives at the Bursar’s Office. If you do not receive the MPN instructions (a new loan) or PLUS application(s), contact the Financial Aid Office toll free for residents outside New York State at 888.645.0030, or locally at 212.645.0030, extension 4090.</p>

<p>A signed MPN is required to be submitted only once and remains valid for up to 10 years. The Direct Loan is thus renewed automatically for eligible returning students, and will be confirmed each year by a Statement of Disclosure sent to you from your lender. (You must, however, first submit a FAFSA each year.)</p>

<p><strong>Direct Subsidized Loan:</strong> As part of your financial aid package, we may suggest that you borrow through the Direct Student Loan Program, formerly the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. This loan is obtained through Direct Loans, Department of Education. During the first year of study, you may borrow up to $3,500.</p>

<p>In subsequent years, the amount is increased to $4,500 for a total aggregate amount of $23,000 for the undergraduate years. The total amount borrowed in any year may not exceed the cost of education minus the total family contribution and minus all other financial aid received that year. The interest rate for 2014-2015 is 4.66% capped at 8.25%. Interest does not accrue while in attendance and repayment does not begin until six months after you cease to enroll at least half-time.</p>

<p><strong>Direct Unsubsidized Loan:  </strong>The terms and conditions are essentially the same as the regular Direct Subsidized Loan, except the Federal government does not pay the interest on this loan while you are in school. However, you can choose to pay the interest quarterly while attending school. You must begin to repay interest and principal 60 days after the first loan funds are issued. You can defer paying the principal on your loan if you are enrolled at least half-time for the period of the loan. Also, the interest can be “capitalized” (added to the principal) if you want.</p>

<p>The interest rate is variable and is set each year and cannot exceed 8.25 percent. For independent undergraduate students, and some dependent undergraduate students for whom it is documented that their parents cannot obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, the Direct Unsubsidized Loan provides additional loan eligibility beyond any Direct Subsidized loan amounts. Students must first apply for the Direct Subsidized program and will be automatically considered for the Direct Unsubsidized program at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Direct PLUS Loans for Undergraduate Students: </strong>The Direct PLUS Loan enables parents of dependent undergraduate students to borrow up to the full amount of an NYCDA education minus other aid. The annual interest rate is set each year, not to exceed 9 percent. The interest rate for the Direct PLUS Loan in 2014-2015 is 6.41% capped at 9.00%. Unlike the other loans we have discussed, repayment of this loan must begin within 60 days after funds are disbursed. There is no grace period for Direct PLUS Loans - the repayment period for each Direct PLUS Loan you receive begins 60 days after your school makes the last disbursement of the loan. However, if you're a parent PLUS borrower who is also a student, you can defer repayment while you're enrolled in school at least half time and for an additional 6 months after you graduate or drop below half-time enrollment. If you're a parent PLUS borrower, you can defer repayment of Direct PLUS Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2008 while the student for whom you obtained the loan is enrolled at least half time, and for an additional 6 months after the student graduates or drops below half-time enrollment (half-time enrollment status is determined by your child's school). You must separately request each deferment period.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Loans:</strong> Private Loans are education loans offered by private lenders to help eliminate or reduce the difference between what NYCDA offers you and what you have to pay. These loans are offered to supplement Federal and State programs. Usually there is a higher interest rate than government loans, and there are no government forms to complete.</p>

<p>Private lenders often require a credit check and/or an income-to-debt ratio check on either you (the borrower), co-signer or both. These loans are not based on financial need. Lenders provide different types of loan programs based on a student's level of study. As a borrower, you should compare competitive interest rates and repayment options with those of other loans, including federal and state education loans, credit cards, personal loans from relatives or friends, and other types of loans.</p>

<p>Because they are less attractive in terms of interest rate and payment options than Federal Student Loans, students and families usually only consider Private or alternative loans when the financial aid package does not provide enough funding to meet needs. </p>

<p><strong>Loan Payment Deferments</strong><br />
If you are already repaying, or expect to begin repaying student loans, and face a particular situation which jeopardizes the repayment schedule, you may apply for deferment status, and, in so doing, avoid inadvertently falling into loan default status. Check with your lender for the rules governing eligibility. </p>

<p><strong>Loan Repayment Information</strong><br />
A loan is a debt that must be repaid. In fact, paying your student loans is a great way to build a good credit history. Likewise, failure to repay your student loans can be detrimental to your credit history.</p>
